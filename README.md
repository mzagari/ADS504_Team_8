Project Title:
Classifying Semantic Equivalency Across Patent Applications

Description:
U.S. patent applications require significant manual effort to reconcile similarities across patents and patent domains. Modern data science and natural language processing techniques provide an opportunity to automate this review process. The objective of this study was to explore semantic similarity classification through several experimental approaches, from simple to near-state-of-the-art, toward a hypothesis that patent phrase pairs may be semantically classified. The study performed secondary data analysis of approximately 36,000 sampled U.S. patent phrase pairs, including preliminary data mining and pattern review. The study progressed through three experimental approaches, from simple word counts to context classification and, ultimately, semantic similarity using transformers (neural networks, or BERT). The studyâ€™s final BERT approach demonstrated that semantic similarity classification (automation) is possible for this use case, rejecting a null hypothesis. This conclusion supports promising additional refinement and research.
